        first things first, i changed the url of this site! i realised that it's probably a really bad idea to have both my first and last name public on the internet the way it was, so now its just my first name (which i dont mind sharing) and some initials.
        <br>but other than that i'm not changing the site much! ive added a review, changed my order in the webring, but thats about it.
        <br>i've recently been getting into hacking my old games consoles. like ive homebrewed my wii and my 3ds. been playing a lot of animal crossing wild world!
