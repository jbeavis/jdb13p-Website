Hello! I've moved this site off neocities, because I wanted to learn php.
This log you're reading right now has been brought to you by the power of php! So have all the photos in the gallery too, check THAT out. I do need to figure out how to make those photos have some kind of title or meta data or something so that blind people can read them, that job is nextish. 
After that... SQL!! And then I'm essentially a real web developer. Can you believe it?
This website it also hosted by me! But I need to figure out how I'm securing my server, because I feel like it probably has more holes in it than swiss cheese.
After that, node.js maybe? It's used a lot by my cowowrkers, so I should really learn it, just in case. Or Angular? I thought I'd start with php, because those two looked pretty scary to me.
