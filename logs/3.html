        i have changed SO much! 
        <br>
        here's the run-down. first up, not sure if it was here last time i made a log, but each page now has its own background colour ;). very sexy, i know, i know.
        <br>
        ive added buttons to the cool stuff page! ive added a review in the review's page! 
        <br>
        AND last but most certainly not least, ive made the gallery bearable to look at! dont tell anyone, but theyre all actually links to where ive uploaded the photos on tumblr :| sorry ik its bad but i have a limited amount of storage space here broski!
        <br>
        ive also signed up to a webring! isnt that exciting! drop a message if you found this page this way!
        <br>
        ive convinced my friend to make a website too! its hard to convince my non coder friends that its easy to do, because their immediate response is "duh of course you find it easy, compsci is your whole thing!". but what they fail to realise is that i made my first site as a child, before i properly learned anything, and if 11 yo james can do it, so can you!
