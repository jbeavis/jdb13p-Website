    <p id = "text">this entry is partially just to see what multiple entries look like on one page. hopefully it looks good!
        <br> im debating whether or not to make this a very personal page, for just close friends and strangers on the internet, or not. if i make it very personal, this will be less like a changelog and more of a diary haha.
        <br> obviously the downside to that is strangers seeing my thoughts, but still. i could just take my last name off the site.
        <br> drop me a message if youre reading this! im interested to see if anyone will.
