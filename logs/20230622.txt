I've redesigned the site! I didn't like the side bar, or the way I was using Tumblr to host my photos, (or the way I wrote everything in lowercase...) so I made this instead. It looks pretty similar, I used the same colours and fonts, but it was made mostly from scratch. I've been very bored since uni ended and I went home to my family haha... I'll see if I can find a way to host my old logs here somewhere.
