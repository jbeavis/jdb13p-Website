wow! first entry. exciting stuff
<br>
i made this site for various reasons, the biggest being that i've started to really develop a distate towards web2.0, and how most peoples (including mine!) web presence is on social media.
<br>
i want to occupy a space on the wired, without limitations imposed on me, and without my data being sold to corrupt governments. and so here i am!
<br>
i also wanted a centralised place where a person could find everything i've created or will create. i want to be seen! i want what ive made to be shared! yes a tree still makes a noise when there's nobody around to hear it, but im sure itd prefer to have witnesses. when i make a game i want someone to play it!
<br>
making this blog part of the site was very difficult, and it still doesn't do what I want to do, so i will be updating it.
