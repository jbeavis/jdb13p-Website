        i added a sidebar lol :p i actually changed quite a lot, but unless you look under the hood, that's probably all you'll see. i'm also about to link my itch.io account (even though it has my last name on it :|), as soon as i get to my desktop (so i can upload my last project to it). im making the log about it now rather than later though! because im putting off doing uni work :/ <br> maybe ill change the font of the site too tee hee..........
